# k8s-intro
A short introduction to Kubernetes - slides + demo
* Current title: Kubernetes in One Hour
* Expected length: 1:30 h
* Updated on: 2021.04.19

It all started with the **Kubernetes in 20 minutes** presentation held at **SofUnit 2018**. The title, length, and content have changed over time. 

Files are provided in the following structure:
* *demo-files* folder contains the sample configuration files
* *docker-images* folder and its sub-folders contain the files necessary to produce the referred container images. You may use your own images, but keep in mind that you should adjust the configuration files as well
* *exercise-files* folder contains a set of configuration files suitable for a guided exercise
* *demo-script.txt* file contains the commands used during the demo
* *slides.pfd* file is the current version of the presentation

For better experience load the *demo-script.txt* file in an editor with an integrated terminal (like Visual Studio Code, Kate, Atom, Sublime, etc.), highlight and execute commands one by one, and check the results.

An older version of the demo together with the supporting files used for the seminar **First Steps with Kubernetes** held on 11.02.2021 at SoftUni can be found at https://github.com/shekeriev/softuni-k8s-seminar
